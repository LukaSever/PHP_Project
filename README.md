Client-Server (PHP project)

This project communicates with the server and allows user registration based on specific criteria. 
You can also log in to the server. 
Each role has certain access privileges. 
If you register as an administrator, you'll be able to create administrators, cashiers, registered users, or blocked users.
You can view a list of all locations, users, and roles.
